### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

The deployment process is very much easy in the App Service rather than the VM. The cost is an important factor when a service is choosed. And, I find Azure App service cheaper than the Azure Virtual machine (VM). Region availability is same for both products. You can get full control in the Virtual Machine, however for deplyoying this kind of application does not need any major control. 

In Azure app services, we can directly deploy the code from visual studio. Also, there is a recommendation from the Azure itself to use APP Service if deploying a Web app. I have attach that screenshot in the images folder.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*
